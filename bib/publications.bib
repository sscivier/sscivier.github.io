  title={Improving nonstoquastic quantum annealing with spin-reversal transformations},
  abstract={Nonstoquastic Hamiltonians are hard to simulate due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulation. It is, however, unclear whether nonstoquasticity can lead to advantage in quantum annealing. Here we show that ùëå‚Å¢ùëå interactions between the qubits make the adiabatic path during quantum annealing, and therefore the performance, dependent on spin-reversal transformations. With the right choice of spin-reversal transformation, a nonstoquastic Hamiltonian with ùëå‚Å¢ùëå interaction can outperform stoquastic Hamiltonians with similar parameters. We introduce an optimization protocol to determine the optimal transformation and discuss the effect of suboptimality.}

  title={Perspective on the current state-of-the-art of quantum computing for drug discovery applications},
  abstract={Computational chemistry is an essential tool in the pharmaceutical industry. Quantum computing is a fast evolving technology that promises to completely shift the computational capabilities in many areas of chemical research by bringing into reach currently impossible calculations. This perspective illustrates the near-future applicability of quantum computation of molecules to pharmaceutical problems. We briefly summarize and compare the scaling properties of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms and provide novel estimates of the quantum computational cost of simulating progressively larger embedding regions of a pharmaceutically relevant covalent protein‚Äìdrug complex involving the drug Ibrutinib. Carrying out these calculations requires an error-corrected quantum architecture that we describe. Our estimates showcase that recent developments on quantum phase estimation algorithms have dramatically reduced the quantum resources needed to run fully quantum calculations in active spaces of around 50 orbitals and electrons, from estimated over 1000 years using the Trotterization approach to just a few days with sparse qubitization, painting a picture of fast and exciting progress in this nascent field.}

    title={Gaussian Processes for Probabilistic Estimates of Earthquake Ground Shaking: A 1-D Proof-of-Concept}, 
    abstract={Estimates of seismic wave speeds in the Earth (seismic velocity models) are key input parameters to earthquake simulations for ground motion prediction. Owing to the non-uniqueness of the seismic inverse problem, typically many velocity models exist for any given region. The arbitrary choice of which velocity model to use in earthquake simulations impacts ground motion predictions. However, current hazard analysis methods do not account for this source of uncertainty. We present a proof-of-concept ground motion prediction workflow for incorporating uncertainties arising from inconsistencies between existing seismic velocity models. Our analysis is based on the probabilistic fusion of overlapping seismic velocity models using scalable Gaussian process (GP) regression. Specifically, we fit a GP to two synthetic 1-D velocity profiles simultaneously, and show that the predictive uncertainty accounts for the differences between the models. We subsequently draw velocity model samples from the predictive distribution and estimate peak ground displacement using acoustic wave propagation through the velocity models. The resulting distribution of possible ground motion amplitudes is much wider than would be predicted by simulating shaking using only the two input velocity models. This proof-of-concept illustrates the importance of probabilistic methods for physics-based seismic hazard analysis.},
