% Professional Summary
\section*{Professional Summary}

I am a PhD student in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Oxford, developing probabilistic methods for uncertainty quantification in geophysics. I hold a Master's in Physics from the University of Birmingham and have gained industry experience through internships in quantum computing at D-Wave Systems (Canada) and Riverlane (UK). My research focuses on Gaussian process-based approaches for probabilistic fusion of geospatial datasets, with applications to earthquake ground motion prediction and seismic hazard assessment. I am interested in applying physics-based computational, data science, and machine learning methods to tackle challenges across geoscience, aerospace, sustainability, and emerging technologies, with a particular focus on research opportunities that combine rigorous scientific methodology with practical applications having tangible societal impact.
